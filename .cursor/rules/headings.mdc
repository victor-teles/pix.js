- Capitalize only the first letter of the first word in headings, unless it’s a proper noun (sentence case).
- Use H1 (#) for the document title, H2 (##) for main sections, and H3 (###) for subsections—avoid deeper levels unless essential.
- Keep headings concise (under 10 words) and descriptive of the content below.
- Avoid stacking headings without intervening text (e.g., H2 followed immediately by H3).

- Use simple, plain languageâ€”aim for a 7th-grade reading level where possible.
- Avoid gender-specific terms (e.g., use "they" instead of "he/she").
- Define acronyms and technical terms the first time they appear (e.g., "Application Programming Interface (API)").
- Use descriptive link text (e.g., "Read the API guide" instead of "Click here").
- Include alt text for images, starting with "Image of" and describing the content briefly.

- Provide at least one concrete example for every concept or feature explained.
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps and bulleted lists for non-sequential items.
- Start each step with an action verb (e.g., "Open the file" instead of "The file should be opened").
- Keep steps concise—one action per step—and avoid combining multiple actions.
- Include expected outcomes or screenshots after key steps where helpful.

- Use a conversational yet professional tone—avoid overly formal or casual language.
- Be positive and solution-oriented (e.g., "You can fix this by..." instead of "This won’t work unless...").
- Avoid humor, idioms, or cultural references that may not translate well.
- Use "must" for requirements, "should" for recommendations, and "can" for options.

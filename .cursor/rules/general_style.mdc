- Keep sentences short, direct, and free of unnecessary jargon or buzzwords.
- Use active voice, avoid ambiguity, and prioritize readability.
- Limit sentences to one idea and keep them under 25 words where possible.
- Use present tense for clarity and immediacy.
- Avoid adverbs like "easily" or "quickly" unless they add specific value.
- For lists, use parallel structure and end each item with consistent punctuation (e.g., periods if full sentences, no punctuation if fragments).

- Start with a brief introduction (1-2 sentences) stating the documentâ€™s purpose.
- Order content from general to specific or from most to least important.
- Use short paragraphs (3-5 sentences) to improve scannability.
- Include a table of contents for documents longer than 1000 words.
- Place critical information (e.g., prerequisites, warnings) at the top or in a clearly marked section.

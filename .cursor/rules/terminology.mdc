- Replace "e.g." with "for example".
- Replace "i.e." with "that is".
- Address the reader directly using "you" instead of "we", "I", or "our".
- Use "application" instead of "app" for clarity in formal docs.
- Use "click" for mouse actions and "tap" for touch actions, not "select" unless choosing an option.
- Avoid "etc."â€”list items explicitly or use "and similar items".
